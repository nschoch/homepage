Iâ€™m in San Diego, and I spend most of my time on these things (in order of time spent):

1. Being a husband and father
2. Working with owners of commercial real estate to <a href="/apartment-loans">help them find the best loan for their properties</a>
3. Reading books and listening to podcasts to think, create, and live better
4. Training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
5. Training compound barbell exercises and calisthenics
6. Homebrewing beer
