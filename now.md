I’m in San Diego, and I spend most of my time on these things (in order of time spent):

1. Working in commercial real estate lending for a bank finding new ways to increase efficiency and deliver a better product to the bank’s customers
2. Being a husband and father
3. Reading books and listening to podcasts to think, create, and live better
4. Training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
5. Training compound barbell exercises and calisthenics along the guidelines of Dan John’s push, pull, squat, hinge, carry
6. Homebrewing beer
