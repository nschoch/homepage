I’m in San Diego, and I spend most of my time on these things (in order of time spent):

1. Being a husband and father
2. Working with owners of commercial real estate to help them find the best loan for their properties
3. Reading books and listening to podcasts to think, create, and live better
4. Training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
5. Training compound barbell exercises and calisthenics along the guidelines of Dan John’s push, pull, squat, hinge, carry
6. Homebrewing beer
