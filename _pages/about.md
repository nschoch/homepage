## Me in 10 seconds

I am a San Diego native that lives in North Park with my wife and three children.

I provide an independent, one-stop solution for investors looking for an experienced advisor to guide them through financing their apartments. I have 14-years of experience in commercial real estate lending, financing apartments, manufactured housing communities, retail, industrial, and office buildings. I left banking so that I can focus on helping owners of apartments by brokering the best loan for their needs.

In addition to offering my commercial mortgage broker services directly, I wrote a do-it-yourself <a href="/project" class="js-no-ajax">apartment financing handbook and tools</a> to help investors get started with financing their 5+ multifamily apartments.
