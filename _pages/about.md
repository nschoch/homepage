## Me in 10 seconds

I am a San Diego native that lives in North Park with my wife and three children.

I provide an independent perspective for investors looking for experienced advice about financing their commercial real estate. I have 14-years of experience in commercial real estate lending, financing apartments, manufactured housing communities, retail, industrial, and office buildings.

In addition to advising investors, I wrote a do-it-yourself <a href="/project" class="js-no-ajax">apartment financing handbook and tools</a> to help investors get started with financing their 5+ unit multifamily apartments.
