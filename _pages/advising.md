### My approach
I make my 15-years of commercial lending experience available to real estate investors looking to answer their commercial real estate financing and investment questions. This is especially helpful for investors that are comfortable working with lenders and just need an experienced, independent perspective on capital sources, loan terms, and process. My motivation is to help investors who want to finance their own properties.

## Do it yourself...

I wrote a concise apartment financing handbook to help you understand and become more comfortable with the financing process. Combine this handbook with the calculators and tools below and you'll be on your way to handling your own commercial mortgage loan. In addition, I encourage you to read my articles for more information.
