You can see the books I have read along with my notes on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/nschoch).

I read most books on a Kindle so I can easily highlight and save parts of the books that I find useful or interesting. I will often revisit a book by reading these highlights. That said, I have re-read a book that I highlighted only to add even more highlights.
