## It isn't that hard

Finding a loan for your apartment isn't that difficult. 
I worked in commercial real estate lending for a large regional bank for 14-years, and I want to help apartment owners find the right loans for their properties. I wrote a short apartment financing handbook to help you understand and become more comfortable with the process. If you still need help, send me a message and we'll talk about your needs.

Alternatively, you can shoot me an email. I'm at nick@nickschoch.com
