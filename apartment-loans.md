## It isn't that hard

Finding a loan for your apartment isn't that difficult. 
I worked in commercial real estate lending for a large regional bank for 14-years, and I want to help apartment owners find the right loans for their properties. I wrote a short apartment financing handbook to help you understand and become more comfortable with the process. If you still need help, send me a message and we'll talk about your needs.

<a href="https://m.me/the.nick.schoch" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fab fa-facebook-messenger"></i> Instant message me on Facebook</a> if you want to discuss financing for your apartment.

Alternatively, you can send me an email. I'm at <a href="mailto:nick@nickschoch.com?subject=Apartment loans">nick@nickschoch.com</a>

I don't have staff, it's just me. I want to build lasting relationships with apartment investors. The buck stops with me, and I will work to earn your trust. Mortgage bankers (also known as brokers) charge hefty fees ranging from 0.50%-2.00%. My fee is 1% of the loan amount and you pay only if you close a loan with me. You'll pay a lot, but you'll get more than you paid for.

A good broker should provide value in many ways such as:
* Eliminating the potential risk of dealing with a single lender
* Providing a sold network of professionals, including accountants, appraisers, and attorneys that the broker works with on a regular basis
* Helping a wise business person access the right financing, just as a wise business person wouldn't enter a courtroom without the right lawyer
* Leveraging lender relationships to secure an accelerated processing of the loan application
* Navigating the commercial lending world, similar to a sponsor in an investment deal
