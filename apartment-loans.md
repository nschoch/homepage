## Complexity simplified

Finding a loan for your apartment can seem daunting initially. There are many potential lenders, numerous structural terms, and complicated loan documents. I know about this because I worked in commercial real estate lending for a large regional bank for 14-years. I have seen what happens when a property owner is unprepared or inexperienced and it isn't good. I went out on my own to help fix this.

## Do it yourself...

To help you get started, I wrote a short apartment financing handbook to help you understand and become more comfortable with the process. In addition, I created a few straight forward tools to help you.

### My approach
I don't have staff, it's just me. I want to build lasting relationships with apartment investors. The buck stops with me, and I will work to earn your trust. Mortgage bankers (also known as brokers) charge hefty fees ranging from 0.50%-2.00%. My fee is 1% of the loan amount and you pay only if you close a loan with me. If a lender provides a rebate or referral payment, I will credit that back to you.

A loan broker should do all of the following for you:
* Understand your wealth strategy and how commercial real estate helps you meet your goals
* Develop a plan to finance your property with a loan structure that fits your goals
* Update you on current commercial real estate trends and how they affect you
* Explain the financing process and set your expectations accordingly
* Provide transparency into the financing process and keep you up to date as your loan progresses
* Translate banking jargon into language you understand
* Advocate on behalf of you and your property to get you the best terms from lenders
