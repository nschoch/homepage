<h1>It isn't that hard</h1>

Finding a loan for your apartment isn't that difficult. 

I worked in commercial real estate lending for a large regional bank for 14-years, and I want to help apartment owners find the right loans for their properties. I wrote a short apartment financing handbook to help you understand and become more comfortable with the process. If you still need help, send me a message and we'll talk about your needs.
