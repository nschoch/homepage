# What is this? #

My name is Nick Schoch, and I listen to podcasts. Not occasionally but quite regularly. I listen while I’m driving, doing dishes, working out, listening to my wife, and... Maybe not that last one.

My point is I relish podcasts, especially the 2-3 hour long-form interviews with interesting people. I started to realize I knew more about Richard Branson and Jamie Foxx’s story than I did some of my family and friends. That’s when I realized we all have a story to tell but no one is interviewing us to help us share our wisdom.

Shortly after my grandmother died in 2011, one of my cousins sent around an mp3 of a few voicemails from grandma:.

<blockquote>
  <p>This is your grandma just checkin’ in. They said you had called. Just checking in. I’m with you all the way and I love you. Grandma is always here for you. Okay, talk to you later.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>This is your grandma call me back when you can. I’m home. I’m always home. Talk to you later. I love you. Bye bye.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Hi this is grandma. I wish you would call me. I’d like to talk to you. I love you very much. Bye bye.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Hi this is grandma. Would you give me a call as soon as you can. It’s important. Okay. Talk to you later. Love you much.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Hi this is your poor old sick grandma. Haven’t heard from you in a long time. I would really like to. Love you much. Bye bye.</p>
</blockquote>

Out of context, it sounds like my cousin wasn’t great at returning phone calls. I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt. Nonetheless, while the content tells only an implicit story of love and connection, there is tremendous value for me in hearing her voice again after many years. Her voice brings back the stories in my memory. I only wish I had taken the time to sit down and capture record a few hours of her wisdom.

I didn’t want to miss that opportunity, again. In 2015, I started recording interviews with the people in my life--my friends and family. I made the process informal and as easy as possible. We sit in a comfortable and quiet place in their home, fire up a recorder, and have a conversation, starting with easy questions like “where did you grow up” or “what are some of your favorite memories.” 2-3 hours later, we realize how much time has passed and we stop the recorder. We walk away from that session with, not just a recorded story we can look back at and share, but also a deeper connection. Knowing the stories that matter to our friends and family connect us with what makes them who they are.

I worked for years in commercial real estate banking and always felt there had to be a better way to deliver value to people and give back. I think helping people capture the stories that matter to them and building deeper connections is the way to do that.

I would love to help you connect with and capture the stories from those that matter to you. If you’re interested, please contact me and let’s preserve the stories that matter together!


# I would like to set up an interview
Great! There are a ton of ways to do this. I recommend reaching out to me over Facebook Messenger so we can talk more about how set up your interview. Some things to think about:

## Who are we interviewing?
Who do you want to interview him/her? I can do the interview using questions you provide or using some of my own questions. Alternatively, you can do the interview and I provide the equipment and editing.
Would you be open to me interviewing you about why you want to interview the him/her? Sharing your interview with your interviewee helps them understand your objective and get comfortable with the interview concept.
