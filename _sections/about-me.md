Life student, husband, and father. San Diego native. I live in North Park with my wife and two (soon three) children.

I have 14-years of experience in commercial real estate lending, financing apartments, manufactured housing communities, retail, industrial, and office buildings. I recently left banking so that I can focus on helping owners of apartments find the best commercial mortage loan for their needs. <br /><br />
