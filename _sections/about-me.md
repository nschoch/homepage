I am a San Diego native that lives in North Park with my wife and three children.

I provide an independent, one-stop solution for investors looking for an experienced advisor to guide them through the financing their apartments. I have 14-years of experience in commercial real estate lending, financing apartments, manufactured housing communities, retail, industrial, and office buildings. I left banking so that I can focus on helping owners of apartments find the best commercial mortage loan for their needs.
<br /><br />
In addition to offering my services directly, I wrote a do-it-yourself <a href="/apartment-loans/#tools">apartment financing handbook and tools</a> that help investors get started with financing their 5+ multifamily apartments.
