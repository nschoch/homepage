I’m in San Diego, and I spend most of my time on these things (in order of time spent):

1. Working in commercial real estate lending for a bank finding new ways to increase efficiency and deliver a better product to the bank’s customers
2. Being a husband and father
3. Reading books and listening to podcasts to think, create, and live better
4. Training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
5. Training compound barbell exercises and calisthenics along the guidelines of Dan John’s push, pull, squat, hinge, carry
6. Homebrewing

I have been investigating using a hammock instead of a tent when camping.

Pros:
* Off the ground
* Better sleep

Cons:
* Need two conveniently placed trees
* Need a hammock for every tent occupant (can't double up)

I ordered a [Dutchware Chameleon](https://dutchwaregear.com/) for my next camping trip later this month. I am planning to build a portable hammock stand out of steel pipes ([instructions](https://theultimatehang.com/2012/07/02/portable-hammock-pipe-stand/)) just in case I don't have trees.
