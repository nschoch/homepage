I’m in San Diego, and I spend most of my time on these things (in order of time spent):

1. Working in commercial mortgage for a bank finding new ways to increase efficiency and deliver a better product to the bank’s customers
2. Being a husband and father
3. Reading books and listening to podcasts to think, create, and live better
4. Training 2-3 days a week with compound lifts such as the squat, bench press, deadlift
5. Training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
6. Homebrewing
